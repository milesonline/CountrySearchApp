# Country Search Application Challenge

This project was created for a coding challenge with a prompt that warranted a small web aplication, Using Front-End and Back-End Technology.
the small web application was to display a list of World countries with an implemented search bar space

Accompanied by a search bar in which a user can input a string of any country they desire within an external backend data base, this fetches the matching data that is found in the database
